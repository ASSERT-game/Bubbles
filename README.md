# Bubbles

Avoid the circles!

Update:
Elastic collisions are difficult to do. For example, adding
a positive float vs its negative version produce different
results. I was losing momentum to a wall because of this.

Getting a bug where objects stay stuck inside one another
and this causes the velocities to increase abnormally. I have a guess why this happens, but this collision stuff is hard.
